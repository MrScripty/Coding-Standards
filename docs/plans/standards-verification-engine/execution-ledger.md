# Generic Standards Verification Engine Execution Ledger

## 2026-08-07 - Re-plan Trigger And Baseline

- Operation: `start`
- Prior revision: `160ea4f5`
- Trigger: the requested objective expanded from repairing four
  Cross-Platform Bash checkers to designing and building one generic engine
  that replaces most bespoke scripts.
- Repository state: Coding-Standards clean; Pantograph has two unrelated user
  proposal changes and is outside this plan's write set.
- Measured baseline: 274 `verify-*.sh` scripts, 290 fixture files, 166 verifier
  scripts containing verifier/helper invocations, 43 scripts using `sed`, and
  13 scripts using the existing decision-table helper.
- Toolchain evidence: the repository has no Python, Cargo, Go, or Node project
  manifest; the current environment provides Python 3.12.3 and Rust 1.92.0.
- Decision: select a Python 3.11+ standard-library engine, declare its
  capability contract explicitly, prohibit runtime packages and arbitrary
  commands, and migrate in owner-bounded waves.
- No-fallback result: no checker or source was edited; the blocked
  Cross-Platform source remains unchanged pending the new engine contract.
- Next slice: accept Milestone 0 planning authority, then implement Milestone
  1's executable kernel and replace the Build owner checker.

## 2026-08-07 - Milestone 0 Contract Accepted

- Outcome: accepted one engine architecture, runtime/dependency decision,
  no-fallback boundary, migration sequence, and parent-plan delegation.
- Verification: the canonical plan-structure checker passed for both the new
  plan and the parent standards-restructure plan; link/identity scans and
  `git diff --check` passed.
- Scope: planning authority only. No standard, verifier, fixture, disposition,
  generated artifact, source index, configuration, or lockfile changed.
- Next slice: implement the strict kernel, register Build owner behavior, and
  delete `verify-build-owner-contract.sh`.

## 2026-08-07 - Milestone 1 Target Re-plan

- Trigger: deletion preflight found `verify-build-owner-contract.sh` in the
  frozen row-35 README dependency audit. Its owning verifier requires all 33
  paths to exist, so deleting Build alone would invalidate shared historical
  evidence and retaining a wrapper would violate the no-legacy contract.
- Decision: keep shared row-35 migration authority unchanged in the kernel
  slice. Replace `verify-rust-test-style.sh`, a measured leaf with no inbound
  script, manifest, plan, or documentation reference.
- Preserved behavior: 16 typed test-style decisions; Verification and Rust
  recipe text; rejection of old mandatory test naming; and exact `STD-0839`
  disposition.
- No-fallback result: the unaccepted Build declarative draft is not retained,
  and no Build wrapper, path alias, or historical-manifest exception is added.
- Deferred owner: Milestone 3 must migrate historical checker-identity audits
  when it replaces shared migration contracts.

## 2026-08-07 - Milestone 1 Kernel And First Replacement

- Outcome: accepted a Python 3.11+ standard-library engine with strict TOML
  registry/suite loading, contained repository paths, acyclic dependency
  scheduling, once-only execution, typed text/JSON diagnostics, required and
  prohibited text checks, and ordered decision predicates.
- Migrated suite: `rust-test-style` preserves 16 typed decisions, four
  Verification sections, three Rust recipe signals, rejection of the old
  mandatory naming phrase, and the exact `STD-0839` disposition prefix.
- Removed authority: `verify-rust-test-style.sh` is deleted. One policy-free
  `verify-declarative-suites.sh` launcher lets the current complete-suite
  convention execute all registered engine suites; it contains no assertion,
  command action, compatibility parser, or fallback.
- Focused verification: 10 Python self-tests passed, including malformed TOML,
  path and symlink escape, missing input, dependency cycle, reverse registry
  order, dependency diamond once-only execution, decision mismatch, strict
  fields, and JSON diagnostics. Direct and launcher suite runs passed; Python
  compilation, launcher shell syntax, removed-path scan, and diff integrity
  passed.
- Complete verification: all 274 mixed migration entrypoints passed. The count
  remains stable because one generic launcher replaced one deleted leaf script.
- Deviation: the proposed Build pilot was replaced before acceptance after
  preflight found its frozen row-35 path dependency. No Build suite or wrapper
  remains.
- No-fallback result: no arbitrary command, dynamic code, environment
  interpolation, old schema, path escape, skipped dependency, Build alias, or
  deleted Rust checker remains available.
- Next slice: derive exact checker-family/dependency inventory and freeze the
  first coherent structural migration package.

## 2026-08-07 - Parent Plan Reconciliation

- Parent milestone `7.4c3ve1` now records delegated engine Milestone 1 as
  accepted and points its one next slice at exact checker inventory.
- This transition changes planning state only. Engine source, registry, suites,
  standards, fixtures, migration manifests, and generated artifacts are
  unchanged.

## 2026-08-07 - Milestone 2 Exact Structural Inventory

- Outcome: accepted a deterministic Python generator and committed TSV for all
  274 current Bash verifier entrypoints. The generic launcher checks freshness
  before running declarative suites.
- Measured fields: line count; total and executable/contract/documentation
  inbound references; verifier/helper dependencies; and `sed`, AWK, `rg`, and
  legacy decision-helper use.
- Baseline: 77 scripts have no named verifier/helper dependency, 47 use `sed`,
  249 use AWK, 264 use `rg`, and 13 invoke the legacy decision helper.
- Focused verification: 13 engine/inventory self-tests, generated-inventory
  check, generic launcher, launcher syntax, and diff integrity passed. The stale
  inventory negative case returned `INVENTORY.STALE`.
- Complete verification: all 274 mixed migration entrypoints passed with
  inventory freshness enforced.
- Semantic review: froze `M2-P1` as eight dependency-free Rust Tooling suites
  with one owner, consolidation risk, common assertion family, no executable or
  frozen-contract path dependencies, and one package gate. Rust Release remains
  separate despite matching shell shape.
- No-fallback result: inventory does not infer owner/risk/disposition, execute
  commands, ignore stale output, or classify documentation as an executable
  dependency.
- Next slice: implement `M2-P1` without changing engine source or shared
  historical migration contracts.
